# proyecto-final-emprendimiento-java
API Rest con Spring
Let me tell you this short story about a pythoneer that was taken away from his comfort zone. He dreamed about using lambda functions and using a single line to print something out. But one day, something terrible happened, he found out that he was going to learn Java, his computer hated it so he couldn't even try to run maven. Then one day after reinstalling his OS, he finally made it...it was the last few days to complete a project in JAVA...his eyes were similar to fried eggs, his graduation went up like crazy, but he managed to be added to the spreadsheet...Saturday 13:45...his last hope to pass...

This project almost took away my willingness to live. Hope you like it :) I made it with my tears
